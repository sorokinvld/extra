## how it works

Sure! Let's break down the code and explain it in a simple way:

- We have a list of hotel ratings and reviews given by different users.
- We want to recommend hotels to a specific user based on their ratings and reviews.
- First, we organize this data into a table called a DataFrame. Each row in the table represents a user's rating and review for a hotel.
- We assign a sentiment value (positive or negative) to each review to understand if the user liked or disliked the hotel.
- We remove any duplicate entries to make sure we have unique ratings and reviews for each user-hotel combination.
- Next, we create a user-item matrix. This matrix represents users as rows and hotels as columns, with the ratings as values.
- Now, we calculate the similarity between the target user and other users using a method called cosine similarity. It helps us measure how similar the users are based on their ratings and sentiment values.
- We find the index of the target user in the DataFrame.
- We sort the similarity scores of the target user with other users and get the indices of the most similar users.
- From these similar users, we select the top ones.
- We then look at the hotels these top similar users rated highly and recommend those hotels to the target user.
- Finally, we select the top 3 recommended hotels based on their average ratings.
- We convert the recommended hotels into a list format that can be easily sent in JSON format as a response.

In summary, the code takes user ratings, reviews, and sentiment values into account, calculates similarity with other users, and recommends the top 3 hotels that similar users have rated highly.
